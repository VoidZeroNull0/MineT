# MineT:
MineT is a clanky bash-written terminal game, based on Microsoft's Minesweeper.
Feel free to flag mines!

# Controls:
* WASD - to move around the field.
* e - to reveal area or one square.
* f - to flag suspicious squares.

# How to win or lose:
* To win the game you need to flag all the mines correctly.
* To lose the game you need to reveal a mine. Ups!

# Changing game settings:
To make field bigger change "x_size" or "y_size" variables in the script, to put more mines - "mines".
